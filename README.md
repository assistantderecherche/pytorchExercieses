Learning PyTorch along with Andrej Karpathy lecture:

"Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out." https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY

m50.pt model:
	Trained using the v3.py version of the code
	Ran for 50K steps
	To run the m50.pt model:
		python load.py

	To re-train m50.pt model:
		python v3.py
		training is deterministic (seeds are set so you'll get the same model every time)
